During this project, I improved my understanding of:
- How to create and organize classes in Java
- Encapsulation and data protection with private attributes
- Using methods to implement business logic (deposit and withdraw)
- Organizing code with packages (e.g., utilit√°rios)
- Using a helper class (Teclado) for user input
